%HOMOGRAPHY Estimate homography
%
% H = HOMOGRAPHY(P1, P2) is the homography (3x3) that relates two
% sets of 4 corresponding points P1 (2x4) and P2 (2x4) from two different
% camera views of a planar object.
%
% Notes::
% - The points must be corresponding, no outlier rejection is performed.
% - The points must be projections of points lying on a world plane
